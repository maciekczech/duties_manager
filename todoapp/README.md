Project of a web app used to manage responsibilies.
Core of the app is written in clojure.
Logic and most of the views are written in JavaScript.
Enhanced by some css.
Eazy to run using Leiningen - once Leiningen is installed, simple 'lein run' command anywhere in a project directory should do the work and set up a web server on localhost:8080/ unless different port is defined in system environment.
